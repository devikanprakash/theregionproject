				<h2>Regional Shake Ups</h2>
				<p>As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, global and local trends have an increasing impact on the region. By understanding and anticipating these trends, or shake-ups, we can create designs that ensure that the region’s systems are better prepared for the future.</p>					
				<p>What positive and negative implications result from these trends? How can design solutions address these trends to improve the region?</p>

					<h3>Rising Regionalization</h3>
					<p>As the number of people living in urban areas increase, regions become vaster and denser creating the areas known as mega-regions. The rapid growth of these mega-regions create new connections, which impact the climate, regional services (such as transit infrastructure), cultural identities, emergency response systems, watersheds, and economic exchanges.</p>

					<h3>Rising Integration of Digital Technology</h3>
			<p>Increased digital connection and the resulting rise of cyber-dependency have caused both positive and negative social changes. On the one hand we have easier access to knowledge, people, and organizations, while on the other are breakdowns in privacy, security, and governance.</p>

					<h3>Climate Change</h3>
			<p>Climate change causes deterioration in air, soil, and water quality, which causes increased stress on the region’s natural, physical, and social systems. Longer shoulder seasons, increase in flooding, and more frequent extreme weather patterns will change the landscape and services of the region.</p>

					<h3>Growing Income Gap</h3>
			<p>The ability to work will become more challenging in the coming decade, and, when combined with the rising cost of living, will lead to increases in the income inequality gap. The widening gap leads to poorer health and lost productivity among low-income populations leading to higher health care costs and economic polarity spanning the region.</p>

					<h3>Aging Population</h3>
			<p>The average age of the region’s population is increasing as baby boomers age and as young couples choose to have fewer, if any, children. This means there will be a growing dependent population and a shrinking workforce, which will cause challenges for the region’s productivity and economic growth.</p>

					<h2>The Greater Golden Horseshoe</h2>
					<p>The Greater Golden Horseshoe Region (GGH) covers 32,000 km2, spanning the shoreline of Lake Ontario from Niagara to the rural Northumberland County, and stretching north to Lake Simcoe and the Georgian Bay. Within this area are booming cities, growing suburban areas, rural municipalities, agricultural communities, and a large protected greenbelt. </p>
					<p>It is composed of 110 separate municipal jurisdictions with many people living in one part of the region, and working or studying in other areas. It is Canada’s largest urbanized area! </p>

					<h2>A Fragmented Region</h2>
					<p>Our region is defined by a vast network of living connections whose effects we feel on a daily basis. Nevertheless, when thinking about or planning our region we have a tendency to fragment our region and work at a municipal level. Nowhere is this clearer than in this collaged map of individual municipal  zoning regulations. This attempt at creating a regional zoning map composed of 155 maps reveals that despite the fact that we live across boundaries, each part of the region plans by itself.</p>
					<p>What more could we accomplish if we were all working from a common map, instead of many isolated ones?</p>

					<h2>The Floodbelt</h2>
					<p>What would happen if Lake Ontario overflowed its shores?</p>
					<p>TThe effects of climate change are already being felt within the region. Lake Ontario’s water levels are at their highest ever - breaking a record that had stood since 1952. We explored what might happen if this level of flooding continued to progress to uncover the region’s Floodbelt.</p>

					<h2>Hyper Expansion</h2>
					<p>How would the region grow if we constructed a hyper transit rail system?</p>
					<p>The proposed high speed rail line from Toronto to Windsor will travel at speeds exceeding 250 km/h, making the travel time to London only 73 minutes. This made us consider what might the future one-hour commute look like? Which cities might open up to our regional connections because of the collapsing of time? When our region explores hyper transit rail, we might experience hyper expansion. </p>

					<h2>Highway Lines</h2>
					<p>What would happen if we replaced all of our highways with trains?</p>
					<p>Our regional transit system is great if you want to travel to one destination: downtown Toronto. However, cross-regional transit systems are either non-existent or quite inefficient. In a world where we are trying to reduce the amount of cars on the road, what would a transit system look like based on other existing infrastructure?</p>

				<h2>What are living Connections?</h2>
				<p>Regions are alive. They are more than just a set of municipalities. They are breathing with relationships from the micro to the macro, from the obvious to the unseen, from the dollars, policies and zoning, to the heart-wrenchingly human. The more interconnected these relationships are, the more positive an impact on the region. A region is living connections.</p>
				<p>
					Living connections can be categorized into six broad categories. Each of these categories is a complex system and has an unlimited amount of connections within it.
				</p>
				<div class="row grid">
					<article class="col-6">
						<h3>ECONOMIC EXCHANGE</h3>
						<p>Economic exchange is the glue that binds a region together. Its hubs are the heart of the living connections. Close proximities and industry clusters allow the flow of work, business and economic trade to connect different municipalities together. The strength of an economy in one part of the region, if connected, gets distributed throughout.</p>
					</article>
					<article class="col-6">
						<h3>SHARED INFRASTRUCTURE</h3>
						<p>Regions share a set of built infrastructure that physically connects municipalities together such as roads, water treatment plants and pipes. 
						</p>
					</article>
					<article class="col-6">
						<h3>Natural Systems</h3>
						<p>Natural systems create a region’s shared dependency. We, quite literally, are connected through the resources we rely on to live. Our watersheds, air quality, drinking water, food and natural beauty is regionally bounded. Natural systems are the bones that connect the region.
						</p>
					</article>
					<article class="col-6">
						<h3>Knowledge Sharing</h3>
						<p>Academic institutions, industry conferences, digital media and other forms of knowledge sharing span over multiple municipalities and attract people from different parts of a region. 
						</p>
					</article>
					<article class="col-6">
						<h3>Cultural Ties</h3>
						<p>Shared cultural ties create identities throughout a region and can form bonds that increase empathy amongst people. Multiple cultures sharing the same physical space can create new connections that enhance innovation through perspective mashing.
						</p>
					</article>
					<article class="col-6">
						<h3>Political Boundaries</h3>
						<p>The political connections and regulations that function between regional municipalities must communicate and work together to enhance the other living connections that flow across borders.

				<h2>Blocks Mapping</h2>
				<p>What if the region was zoned through an even spread of zoning blocks?</p>
				<p>Regions function because of their diversity. They are the culmination of urban, suburban and rural. However, we explored what an entire region might look if it was laid out and zoned in blocks based evenly on type of usage. Switch between these maps to reimagine the region through different zoning types. </p>
				<p>Each map uses a block of 25 square km to reimagine the region. </p>
