			<h1>Phenomena</h1>
			<p>Regions are unique for their vast geographical size, large population, immense connectivity, and variation in scale. While this set of conditions is typical of regions across the world, how they manifest can have tremendous variation. These Regional Phenomena help to understand how regions function, and in turn, how to influence their function.</p>

Today, similar clashes arise when considering the 416 area vs. the 905. Creating boundaries that are reflective of the population, the economic functions, and efficient service providing proves to be a challenge.</p>

			<h2>Regional Shake Ups</h2>
			<p>As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, global and local trends have an increasing impact on the region. By understanding and anticipating these trends, or shake-ups, we can create designs that ensure that the region’s systems are better prepared for the future.</p>
			<br />
			<p>What positive and negative implications result from these trends? How can design solutions address these trends to improve the region?</p>
			<br />
			<h3>Rising Regionalization</h3>
			<p>As the number of people living in urban areas increase, regions become vaster and denser creating the areas known as mega-regions. The rapid growth of these mega-regions create new connections, which impact the climate, regional services (such as transit infrastructure), cultural identities, emergency response systems, watersheds, and economic exchanges.</p>
			<br />
			<h3>Rising Integration of Digital Technology</h3>
			<p>Increased digital connection and the resulting rise of cyber-dependency have caused both positive and negative social changes. On the one hand we have easier access to knowledge, people, and organizations, while on the other are breakdowns in privacy, security, and governance.</p>
			<h3>Climate Change</h3>
			<p>Climate change causes deterioration in air, soil, and water quality, which causes increased stress on the region’s natural, physical, and social systems. Longer shoulder seasons, increase in flooding, and more frequent extreme weather patterns will change the landscape and services of the region.</p>
			<br />
			<h3>Distance is Collapsing</h3>
			<p>Organized regional transportation and new rapid transit expansions connect and traverse municipal boundaries. Combined with accelerating digital technologies, physical distances are overcome through mobile devices and ICT.</p>
			<br />
			<h3>Growing Income Gap</h3>
			<p>The ability to work will become more challenging in the coming decade, and, when combined with the rising cost of living, will lead to increases in the income inequality gap. The widening gap leads to poorer health and lost productivity among low-income populations leading to higher health care costs and economic polarity spanning the region.</p>
			<h3>Aging Population</h3>
			<p>The average age of the region’s population is increasing as baby boomers age and as young couples choose to have fewer, if any, children. This means there will be a growing dependent population and a shrinking workforce, which will cause challenges for the region’s productivity and economic growth.</p>
