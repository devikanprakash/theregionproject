			<h2>Regional Symbiosis</h2>
			<p>Regional symbiosis, or symbiosis, is the functional element of the complex and evolving network of connections, or their relationships. By understanding the value of symbiotic relationships we will be able to use them to develop a stronger regional system for people to live in. 
			Every regional connection, whether it is an economic exchange or infrastructure development, changes depending on the circumstances affecting its relationship. These types of relationships can be categorized into three broad categories. </p>

			<div class="row content">
				<article class="col-3">
					<img src="images/topheavy-01.png">
					<h3>Top Heavy</h3>
					<p>An area sharing resources of another area in usually a one-sided relationship. This can be seen in connections through natural systems. Example: 40% of the world’s population lives in 250 major river basins. Downstream users are constantly affected by upstream use of water.</p>

				<article class="col-3">

					<h3>Dependent</h3>
					<p>Areas that are dependent on other areas in order to function without adversely affecting the other area’s resources. This can be seen in civic connections. Example: </p>

				<article class="col-3">
					<img src="images/supportive-01.png">
					<h3>Supportive</h3>
					<p>Areas are interdependent on each other for growth. This can be seen in economic connections. Example: The relationship between the pharmaceutical cluster in Mississauga and Toronto's medical research cluster connect two industries that support each other economically. </p>

				<h2>What are living Connections?</h2>
				<p>Regions are alive. They are more than just a set of municipalities. They are breathing with relationships from the micro to the macro, from the obvious to the unseen, from the dollars, policies and zoning, to the heart-wrenchingly human. The more interconnected these relationships are, the more positive an impact on the region. A region is living connections.</p>
				<p>
					Living connections can be categorized into six broad categories. Each of these categories is a complex system and has an unlimited amount of connections within it.
				</p>
				<div class="row grid">
					<article class="col-6 row">
						<span class="objective-number">1</span>
						<div>
							<h3>ECONOMIC EXCHANGE</h3>
							<p>Economic exchange is the glue that binds a region together. Its hubs are the heart of the living connections. Close proximities and industry clusters allow the flow of work, business and economic trade to connect different municipalities together. The strength of an economy in one part of the region, if connected, gets distributed throughout.</p>
						</div>
					</article>
					<article class="col-6 row">
						<span class="objective-number">2</span>
						<div>
							<h3>SHARED INFRASTRUCTURE</h3>
							<p>Regions share a set of built infrastructure that physically connects municipalities together such as roads, water treatment plants and pipes. 
							</p>
						</div>	
					</article>
					<article class="col-6 row">
						<span class="objective-number">3</span>
						<div>
							<h3>Natural Systems</h3>
							<p>Natural systems create a region’s shared dependency. We, quite literally, are connected through the resources we rely on to live. Our watersheds, air quality, drinking water, food and natural beauty is regionally bounded. Natural systems are the bones that connect the region.

					<article class="col-6 row">
						<span class="objective-number">4</span>

							<h3>Knowledge Sharing</h3>
							<p>Academic institutions, industry conferences, digital media and other forms of knowledge sharing span over multiple municipalities and attract people from different parts of a region. 
							</p>
						</div>	
					</article>
					<article class="col-6 row">
						<span class="objective-number">5</span>
						<div>
							<h3>Cultural Ties</h3>
							<p>Shared cultural ties create identities throughout a region and can form bonds that increase empathy amongst people. Multiple cultures sharing the same physical space can create new connections that enhance innovation through perspective mashing.

							<h3>Political Boundaries</h3>
							<p>The political connections and regulations that function between regional municipalities must communicate and work together to enhance the other living connections that flow across borders.
