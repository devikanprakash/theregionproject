			<h1>Toronto's Waterfront Case Study</h1>
			<p class="intro-p">Through the IwB’s partnership with Waterfront Toronto, the team applied collaborative design thinking and strategy to develop and implement design projects that enhance the lives of people across the region by facilitating the six living connections.</p>

		<h2>Waterfront Context</h2>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-2">
				<blockquote>How can a waterfront move beyond the edge of a city and into an entire region? </blockquote>
				<blockquote>What if the waterfront was a facilitator for all the living connections that make up a region?</blockquote>
				<blockquote>How can we build our own living connections into our process to design an integrated strategy to make this happen? </blockquote>
			</div>
			<div class="col-2">
				<p>These were some of the questions that we asked ourselves throughout our partnership with Waterfront Toronto, the organization with the extraordinary task of redeveloping and revitalizing Toronto’s massive waterfront. Through a process of research, collaboration, prototyping and a hefty desire to understand and improve the region that we live in, the Institute without Boundaries developed an integrated design strategy and three design projects that connect Toronto’s Waterfront to the wider Greater Golden Horseshoe Region. This is the story of how it happened and how it works.</p>

				<h2>Integrated Design Strategy</h2>
				<p>The IwB’s year long process and the scale of Waterfront’s revitalization has led to a promising integrated design strategy (IDS). This strategy has culminated in the implementation of three prototypes in key locations along the waterfront. The pilots are guided by the IwB’s objectives and strategies in order to create stronger connections between the GGH and the waterfront.</p>
				<p>The living connections methodology led the team to build upon Waterfront Toronto’s priorities regarding neighbourhoods, destinations, engagement, sustainability, and prosperity to create five key strategies that have driven the development of three pilot projects.</p>

			<div class="content">
				<h2>Strategies</h2>
				<p>Five design guidelines have driven the development of twelve projects. These guidelines led to the identification of three main goals and the development of twelve projects over the past nine months. This process led the team to prototype three final projects: The DEC, Path Perks, and Hello Lake. These projects have the potential to be implemented at different scales across the region.</p>
				<section class="strategy-list">
					<div class="row single-strategy">
						<span class="strategy-number">1</span>
						<div>
							<h3>Equally distribute opportunity and access to growth</h3>
							<p>True prosperity comes from equal access to economic opportunity for all; close structural gaps to enable growth in communities and the region. The interconnectivity of the region represents a unique opportunity for economic growth.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="row single-strategy">
						<span class="strategy-number">2</span>

							<h3>Design infrastructure and programming that embraces and adapts to change</h3>

					<div class="row single-strategy">
						<span class="strategy-number">3</span>

							<h3>Implement action through co-creation</h3>
							<p>Leverage participation to amplify conversations into strategic actions, reflective of the diverse voices and values within the region. For a project to be successful, it must incorporate participation from local and regional residents and businesses.</p>

					<div class="row single-strategy">

					<div class="row single-strategy">
						<span class="strategy-number">5</span>

							<h3>Create positive moments along different journeys</h3>
							<p>Journeys and destinations are inseparable; the fulfillment of a destination first requires a seamless and enjoyable journey. The waterfront experience does not begin upon arrival; it begins when the decision is made to visit a given site.</p>

				<h2>Goals</h2>
				<p>Over the course of the past nine months, the IwB team has used regional thinking and research with a focus on human centered designs to achieve three main goals. Throughout the year, the IwB team has focused on proposing, developing and implementing regionally relevant design projects that achieve these three goals.</p>

				<h2>The DEC</h2>
				<p>Downtown Entrepreneur Collective (DEC) aims to meet these needs by implementing a new ground floor strategy along the waterfront. The result will be an animated streetscape filled with a restaurants, coffee shops, bakeries, produce, jewelry stores, bike repair shops and a variety of local, and regional small businesses. Strategically located kiosks will house a variety of businesses becoming a marketplace of goods, services and community organizations.</p>

				<p>Path Perks connects both local and regional residents to waterfront trail systems by encouraging the discovery of assets along and around these trails through a digital application along with physical markers. This allows residents to connect to local businesses and shared spaces through a curated selection of activities and experiences positioning existing pedestrian trails as anchors for city discovery.</p>

				<p>Hello Lake aims to bring the waterfront back into the region through a series of interactive and signature screens throughout the region. These screens allow users to learn more about life on and below the lake. By visually connecting the lake back to the region, Hellow Lake is creating an awareness of the importance of Lake Ontario in all our lives.</p>
