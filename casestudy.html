			<h2>Waterfront Context</h2>
			<div>
				<p>How can a waterfront move beyond the edge of a city and into an entire region? </p>
				<p>What if the waterfront was a facilitator for all the living connections that make up a region?</p>
				<p>How can we build our own living connections into our process to design an integrated strategy to make this happen? </p>
				<p>These were some of the questions that we asked ourselves throughout our partnership with Waterfront Toronto, the organization with the extraordinary task of redeveloping and revitalizing Toronto’s massive waterfront. Through a process of research, collaboration, prototyping and a hefty desire to understand and improve the region that we live in, the Institute without Boundaries developed an integrated design strategy and three design projects that connect Toronto’s Waterfront to the wider Greater Golden Horseshoe Region. This is the story of how it happened and how it works.</p>

				<h2>Integrated Design Strategy</h2>
				<p>The IwB’s year long process and the scale of Waterfront’s revitalization has led to a promising integrated design strategy (IDS). This strategy has culminated in the implementation of three prototypes in key locations along the waterfront. The pilots are guided by the IwB’s objectives and strategies in order to create stronger connections between the GGH and the waterfront.</p>

			<section class="content">
				<h2>Strategies</h2>
				<p>Five strategies were developed to guide the development of three pilot projects to mean three overall goals for the waterfront.</p>
				<div>
					<p>1</p>
						<h3>Equally distribute opportunity and access to growth</h3>
						<p>True prosperity comes from equal access to economic opportunity for all; close structural gaps to enable growth in communities and the region. The interconnectivity of the region represents a unique opportunity for economic growth.</p>
				</div>
						
				<div>
					<p>2</p>
					<h3>Design infrastructure and programming that embraces and adapts to change</h3>
					<p>Change is the only constant; designing for transition stabilizes communities during technological shifts, environmental uncertainty, and changing social structures.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>3</p>
					<h3>Implement action through co-creation</h3>
					<p>Leverage participation to amplify conversations into strategic actions, reflective of the diverse voices and values within the region. For a project to be successful, it must incorporate participation from local and regional residents and businesses.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>4</p>
					<h3>Prompt meaningful interactions</h3>
					<p>Interactions are key to vibrant spaces; dynamic neighborhoods must leverage the influences of nature, infrastructure, and technology to encourage exchange and connections between people and their surroundings. </p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>5</p>
					<h3>Create positive moments along different journeys</h3>
					<p>Journeys and destinations are inseparable; the fulfillment of a destination first requires a seamless and enjoyable journey. The waterfront experience does not begin upon arrival; it begins when the decision is made to visit a given site. </p>
				</div>
			</section>	

			<section class="content">
				<div>
					<h2>Goals</h2>
					<p>The three objectives are used to translate the regional research into actionable projects on the waterfront.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>1</p>
					<p>Create complete commumities by designing the fine grain details of a neighbourhood</p>

				</div>
				<div>
					<p>2</p>
					<p>Showcase actionable sustainable innovation to the region</p>

				</div>
				<div>
					<p>3</p>
					<p>Enhance every part of the journey</p>
