				<h2>What are living Connections?</h2>
				<p>Regions are alive. They are more than just a set of municipalities. They are breathing with relationships from the micro to the macro, from the obvious to the unseen, from the dollars, policies and zoning, to the heart-wrenchingly human. The more interconnected these relationships are, the more positive an impact on the region. A region is living connections.</p>
				<p>
					Living connections can be categorized into six broad categories. Each of these categories is a complex system and has an unlimited amount of connections within it.
				</p>
				<div class="row grid">
					<article class="col-6">
						<h3>ECONOMIC EXCHANGE</h3>
						<p>Economic exchange is the glue that binds a region together. Its hubs are the heart of the living connections. Close proximities and industry clusters allow the flow of work, business and economic trade to connect different municipalities together. The strength of an economy in one part of the region, if connected, gets distributed throughout.</p>
					</article>
					<article class="col-6">
						<h3>SHARED INFRASTRUCTURE</h3>
						<p>Regions share a set of built infrastructure that physically connects municipalities together such as roads, water treatment plants and pipes. 
						</p>
					</article>
					<article class="col-6">
						<h3>Natural Systems</h3>
						<p>Natural systems create a region’s shared dependency. We, quite literally, are connected through the resources we rely on to live. Our watersheds, air quality, drinking water, food and natural beauty is regionally bounded. Natural systems are the bones that connect the region.
						</p>
					</article>
					<article class="col-6">
						<h3>Knowledge Sharing</h3>
						<p>Academic institutions, industry conferences, digital media and other forms of knowledge sharing span over multiple municipalities and attract people from different parts of a region. 
						</p>
					</article>
					<article class="col-6">
						<h3>Cultural Ties</h3>
						<p>Shared cultural ties create identities throughout a region and can form bonds that increase empathy amongst people. Multiple cultures sharing the same physical space can create new connections that enhance innovation through perspective mashing.
						</p>
					</article>
					<article class="col-6">
						<h3>Political Boundaries</h3>
						<p>The political connections and regulations that function between regional municipalities must communicate and work together to enhance the other living connections that flow across borders.

			<h2>Layer Mapping</h2>
			<p>The Greater Golden Horseshoe Region (GGH) covers 32,000 km2, spanning the shoreline of Lake Ontario from Niagara to the rural Northumberland County, and stretching north to Lake Simcoe and the Georgian Bay. Within this area are booming cities, growing suburban areas, rural municipalities, agricultural communities, and a large protected greenbelt.</p>
			<p> 
			It is composed of 110 separate municipal jurisdictions with many people living in one part of the region, and working or studying in other areas. It is Canada’s largest urbanized area!</p>

			<p>Visualize these connections throughout the Greater Golden Horseshoe region. Separate each connection or layer different ones on top of each other to begin to see the system of living connections at work.</p>

				<h2>Regional Shake Ups</h2>
				<p>As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, global and local trends have an increasing impact on the region. By understanding and anticipating these trends, or shake-ups, we can create designs that ensure that the region’s systems are better prepared for the future.</p>					
				<p>What positive and negative implications result from these trends? How can design solutions address these trends to improve the region?</p>

				<div>			
					<h3>Rising Regionalization</h3>
					<p>As the number of people living in urban areas increase, regions become vaster and denser creating the areas known as mega-regions. The rapid growth of these mega-regions create new connections, which impact the climate, regional services (such as transit infrastructure), cultural identities, emergency response systems, watersheds, and economic exchanges.</p>
				</div>
			</article>
			
			<article class="col-6 row">
				<span class="objective-number">2</span>
				<div>			
					<h3>Rising Integration of Digital Technology</h3>
			<p>Increased digital connection and the resulting rise of cyber-dependency have caused both positive and negative social changes. On the one hand we have easier access to knowledge, people, and organizations, while on the other are breakdowns in privacy, security, and governance.</p>
				</div>
			</article>

			<article class="col-6 row">
				<span class="objective-number">3</span>
				<div>			
					<h3>Climate Change</h3>
			<p>Climate change causes deterioration in air, soil, and water quality, which causes increased stress on the region’s natural, physical, and social systems. Longer shoulder seasons, increase in flooding, and more frequent extreme weather patterns will change the landscape and services of the region.</p>
				</div>
			</article>

			<article class="col-6 row">
				<span class="objective-number">4</span>

					<h3>Distance is Collapsing</h3>
			<p>Organized regional transportation and new rapid transit expansions connect and traverse municipal boundaries. Combined with accelerating digital technologies, physical distances are overcome through mobile devices and ICT.</p>
				</div>
			</article>

			<article class="col-6 row">
				<span class="objective-number">5</span>
				<div>			
					<h3>Growing Income Gap</h3>
			<p>The ability to work will become more challenging in the coming decade, and, when combined with the rising cost of living, will lead to increases in the income inequality gap. The widening gap leads to poorer health and lost productivity among low-income populations leading to higher health care costs and economic polarity spanning the region.</p>
				</div>
			</article>

			<article class="col-6 row">
				<span class="objective-number">6</span>
				<div>			
					<h3>Aging Population</h3>
			<p>The average age of the region’s population is increasing as baby boomers age and as young couples choose to have fewer, if any, children. This means there will be a growing dependent population and a shrinking workforce, which will cause challenges for the region’s productivity and economic growth.</p>
