					<p>Regions are not just for urban planners. They are a case study for anyone that cares about the how humans live in the 21st century. They represent a unique opportunity for economic and social growth. With instantaneous information transfer and the subsequent shrinking of distances, existing municipal, social, economic, and political boundaries are no longer sufficient to tackle urban challenges.</p> -->

						<h2>Connected &amp; Unbound</h2>
						<h3>A new regional perspective</h3>
						<p>Regions are unbound by physical borders. Scales of regions vary depending on their connections. Digital infrastructure has collapsed distances to allow transfer of information to take place at every scale. Understanding regional scales helps us understand a different scale through which we connect as humans.</p>
